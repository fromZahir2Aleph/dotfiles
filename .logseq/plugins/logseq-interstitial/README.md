This plugin helps you quickly create time-stamps, without interupting your thought. As a bonus it can start your day with a quote, or a note to self.

## Installation

### Preparation

- Click the 3 dots in the righthand corner and go to **Settings**.
- Go to **Advanced** and enable **Plug-in system**.
- Restart the application.
- Click 3 dots and go to Plugins (or `Esc t p`).

### Install plugin from the Marketplace (recommended) 

- Click the `Marketplace` button and then click `Plugins`.
- Find the plugin and click `Install`.

### Install plugin manually

- Download a released version assets from Github.
- Unzip it.
- Click `Load unpacked plugin`, and select destination directory to the unzipped folder.

## Using the plugin

This plugin makes it *just* a tiny bit easier to use Logseq as an interstitial journal. Two shortcuts that create timestamps, either as a header, or just (bold) text.

Next, it makes it possible to send a note to yourself (write yesterday, see today), or just add a random note to a template.

## Adding timestamps to your journal

![interstial journal example](./img/journal.png)

- Use `Ctrl-t` to insert a timestamp in the current block/line.
- Use `Ctrl-Shift-t` to insert a timestamped heading in the current block/line.

In the settings you can reverse this, so the default `Ctrl-t` becomes a timestamped heading.

### Configuration

![settings](./img/settings.png)

Under settings you can change the default timestamp, and if you want to use *bold* text.

You can choose Markdown or Org-mode, depending on what you use.

The level of the heading, where the timestamp is inserted, defaults to 3 (`### HH:MM <optional title>`)

**New:** It is possible to insert custom markup *around the time*. 

Example: `[<time>]` this wil print: `[20:23]`

Leave blank for default timestamp.

## Templates

![insert templates](./img/demo.gif)

The default way to use the plugin is place one or more *placeholders* in your `daily` template. Then, when the template is run at midnight, a random note and a note to self are block-linked into place.

The plugin gives to commands to insert a "note to self" or a "random quote".

The idea is to put these in a template, and then, when the template is executed, the result will be a linked block to the not e or quote.

Usage:

type: `/Create Note to Self` or `/Create Random Quote`, and it will insert a code-snippet that will then be run with the template.

The default placeholder looks like this: 

- `{{renderer :interstitial, yesterday, ntnds}}`
- `{{renderer :interstitial, random, quote}}`

`yesterday` Will backlink a block from _yesterday_, `random` finds any block in your graph with the specified tag. Next you can alter `ntnds` and `quote`, you can choose any tag you use in your system, these are just the ones I use üòÅ.

These placeholder are _supposed_ to go in your (daily) template, but they will happily work anywhere you put them. If you put them in a template they will wait running, until the template is activated.
